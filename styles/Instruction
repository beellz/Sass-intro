this is section where i write what i learn :

Firstly use $Primary as a variable .
$ with name is variable
u can use it anywhere in scss file,
the changes where u made can be given by 
sass style.scss:style.css (the first should be scss file and with coloum (:) the end file .

if u want it to watch the changes u made just give --watch argv.
so its like 
sass --watch 
sass --watch style.scss:style.css

this start in watch mode where it will see everything u change and compiled it automatically
